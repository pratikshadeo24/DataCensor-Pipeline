████,

I got your email.  I didn't have time to finish it.  I will read it this 
weekend and ask my dad about the a/c's.  I am glad you are enjoying
the job.  ████████████ I will mark up the lease and rules.  If I didn't 
mention this when I was there, the 4th is a paid holiday for you and ████.  
Have a good weekend and I will talk to you █████████.

███████
