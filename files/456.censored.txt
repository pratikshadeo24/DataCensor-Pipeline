██████,

I didn't receive the information on work completed or started.  Please send 
it this morning.  

We haven't discussed how to proceed with the land.  The easiest treatment 
would be just to deed it to us.  However, it might be more
advantageous to convey the partnership.

Also, I would like to speak to Hugo █████.  I didn't find a Quattro 
Engineering in Buda.  Can you put me in contact with him.

Talk to you later.

███████
