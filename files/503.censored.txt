████,

Here is the application from SPB.  I guess they want to use the same form as 
a new loan application.  I have a call in to █████████████ to try to find out 
if there is a shorter form.  What do I need to be providing to the buyer 
according to the contract.  I was planning on bringing a copy of the survey 
and a rentroll including deposits on ██████.  Please let me know this morning 
what else I should be putting together.


███████

I was told that you were faxed the loan application.  I will send attachment
for a backup.  Also, you will need to provide a current rent roll and ███████████ operating history (income & expense).

Call me if you need some help.

Thanks

█████████████
