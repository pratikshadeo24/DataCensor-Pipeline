Subject: re: book admin for Pipe/Gas █████ option book

As you might be aware,  ███████████ (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night █████████ night and until 200 
am ██████  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on ██████ to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

█████
