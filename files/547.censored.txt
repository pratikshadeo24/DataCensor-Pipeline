█████,
  
Can you accomodate ██████ as we have in the past.  This has been very helpful 
in establishing a fair index at Socal Border.

Please cc me on the email with a guest password.  The sooner the better as 
bidweek is underway.

███████,

I was wondering if I could trouble you again for another guest id for eol.
In ███████████████, it has helped us here at NGI when we go to set indexes.

I appreciate your help on this.

██████
