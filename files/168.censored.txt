Log in to www.enrononline.com and install shockwave using instructions 
below.  I have set up a composite page with western basis and cash prices to 
help you filter through the products.  The title of the composite page is 
████'s Page.  If you have any problems logging in you can call me at 
(713)853-7041 or ███████████, EnronOnline HelpDesk, 713/853-HELP (████).


The █████████ installer can be found within "About EnronOnline" on the home 
page.  After opening "About EnronOnline", using right scroll bar, go to the 
bottom.  Click on "download █████████" and follow the directions.  After 
loading █████████, shut down and reopen browser (i.e. Microsoft Internet 
Explorer/Netscape).

I hope you will find this site useful.


Sincerely,
