Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is 
the next logical step.  I had already contacted █████████ and sent him the 
floor plan.
He got back to me █████████ with his first draft.  He took my plan and 
improved it.  I am going to officially engage ████ to draw the plans.  While 
he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification 
list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and 
speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on ██████████████████.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through 
████████?  Also can you provide some references?

Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust 
your bid.
