████,

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse ██████████ because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something █████.



Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start 
collecting.

███████
