███,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for ███████████.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a ████████ contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during ███.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also ████████████████████████ doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?

Thank you,

Phillip
