████████████,

Frogger is leaving shockwave.com soon...

Save it to your ████████████ now! 

Every frog has his day - games, too. Frogger had a great run as an 
arcade classic, but it is leaving the shockwave.com pond soon. The 
good news is that you can download it to your ████████████ and 
own it forever! 

Don't know about ████████████? You can download ████████████ for free 
and save all of your downloadable favorites to play off-line, 
full-screen, whenever you want. 

████████████████ by noon, PST on █████████, while it's still on 
the site!
