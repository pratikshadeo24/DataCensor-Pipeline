██████,

I can take ██████████████████ I get back from vacation.  ███████ between 
█████████████ would work but ██████ or ████████ would be my preference.

Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your 
time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.  The 
items I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just 
clarification of what was in a number.  

Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue ████████ 
morning.  

███████
