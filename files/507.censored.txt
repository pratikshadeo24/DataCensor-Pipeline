████,

Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your 
earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.

But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to 
this question lies in apartment 1,13, and ██, can you update this file and 
send it back.

Now I am going to work on a rentroll for ███████████.  I will probably send 
you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.  Let's get this stuff clean █████.
