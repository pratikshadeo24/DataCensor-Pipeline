Greg,

just a note to let you know I will be out of the office Wed(3/21) until 
Thurs(3/23).  The kids are on ██████ break.  I will be in San Marcos and you 
can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com.

I was planning on stopping by to see █████████████ on ████████ to drop off a 
check and give him the green light to file for replatting.  What will change 
if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change 
what he is going to submit to the city.

I spoke to ██████████████ this morning.  He was contracted to complete the 
soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the 
week.  I don't know who needs this report.  I told ██████ you might call to 
inquire about what work he performed. His number is 512-930-5832.

We spoke on the phone about most of these issues.

Talk to you later.

███████
