███,

Regarding the ████ storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on ████████████████████winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% █████ injection capacity, 10% █████ withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  █████████████████████ spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

███ for a ██████ storage contract beginning ███████ based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

█████████████
