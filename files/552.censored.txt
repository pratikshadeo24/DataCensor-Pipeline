████,

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid ██████ on 1/5.  Then he switched to bi██████.  He should have paid 
260 on ████.  █████████ rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his █████████.  He is only paid ████████ in advance.  This is not a 
big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.

Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent 
you this morning.

Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.
