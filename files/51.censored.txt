Greg,

            The kids are into typical toys and games.  Justin likes power 
ranger stuff.  ██████ really likes art.  Books would also be good.  

            We are spending █████████ in Houston with Heather's sister.  We 
are planning to come to San Marcos for New Years.  

            How long will you stay?  what are your plans?  Email me with 
latest happenings with you in the big city.
