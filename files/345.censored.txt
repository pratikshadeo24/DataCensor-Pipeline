█████,

The two analysts that I have had contact with are ████████████  and Vishal 
Apte.
████ will be represented by █████████████.
Vishal joined our group in ███████.  He was in the Power Trading Group for 
██████████████████.
I spoke to ██████████ and we agreed that he should be in the excellent 
category.  I just don't want Vishal 
to go unrepresented since he changed groups ████████.

Call me with questions.(x37041)
