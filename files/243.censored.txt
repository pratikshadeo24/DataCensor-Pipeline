████,

 I want to speak to ████ myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you 
email me his number I will call him.  
 I would like ████ to direct ████ on renovation tasks and you can give him 
work orders for normal maintenance.

 I will call you ████████ to discuss items from the office.  Do you need ████ 
to come in on any more ███████?  I think I 
 can guess your answer.

 I might stop by ███████████.

███████
