████,

Here is the rentroll from ███████████.  

The closing was to be this ████████ but it has been delayed until ██████████████████.  If you can stay on until ██████████ that would be helpful.  If 
you have made other commitments I understand.

████ is planning to put an A/C in #35. 

You can give out my work numer (713) 853-7041

Phillip
