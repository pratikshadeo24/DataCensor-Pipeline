███,

 Regarding ████████████████ contributions to the west desk █████████, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  █████ stepped up to fill the 
gap left by ███████████ personal leave.  █████ held together the scheduling 
group for ███████████████ by working 7days a week during this time.  █████ 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the █████ operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information █████ provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical █████████ due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

███████
