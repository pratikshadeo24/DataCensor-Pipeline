████,

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for ██████████████████, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and ████ faxed to me █████████.  Paychecks will be issued each ██████ by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since ██████.
 When you open the file, go to the "Checkbook" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

███████
