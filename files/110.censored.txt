Enclosed are demographics on the ████████ site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on ██████████ that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the ████████ project?

██████████
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in ██████████ is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
██████████, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a ████████ lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a ████████ term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

██████████████████
President, Creekside Builders, LLC
