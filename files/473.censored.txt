███,

I was out █████████.  Regarding the Montana supply, you can refer them to 
██████████ in Denver.  

Let me know when you want to have the other meeting.

Also, we frequently give out quotes to mid-marketers on ███████████████ desk 
or Enron marketers in New York where the customer is EES.  I don't understand 
why your people don't contact the desk directly.

███████
