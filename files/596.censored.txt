George & █████,


 If possible,  I would like to get together in Columbus as █████ suggested.  
████████ afternoon is ████████████ that really works for me.  
Let me know if that would work for you.  I was thinking around 2  or 2:30 pm.

I will try to email you any questions I have from the latest proforma 
████████.


███████
