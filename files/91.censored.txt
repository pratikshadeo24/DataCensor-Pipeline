███,

 ██████████████ held together the scheduling group for ██████████ while ██████████ was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  █████ worked ██████ a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on █████.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 █████ is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know 
what is an acceptable cash amount.

███████
