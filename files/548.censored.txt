Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired ██s is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired ██s will be getting a fixed price for ███████ and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of ██ negotiations on ██s & Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE;  Non-Gas-fired ██s -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All ██s but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would "retain" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from ██s who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
██ payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in ████████ 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. ██s are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its ██s; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on ██████.

For gas-fired ██s -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such ██s. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(████████ and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and ██████ are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred █████.

Status of legislation -- ██████ left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the ██s.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.
