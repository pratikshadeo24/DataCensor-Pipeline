██████,

 Here sales numbers from ██████:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
█████████ model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure █████████████ let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

█████████████
