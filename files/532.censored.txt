Got your email.  I will let ███████ know.  I guess we can work out the finer 
points █████████.  The bank here in Houston is dealing with their auditors 
█████████, so unfortunately I did not hear from them █████████.  The are 
promising to have some feedback by ██████.  I will let you know as soon as I 
hear from them.
