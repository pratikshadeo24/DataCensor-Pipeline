When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before ███████████████. 
2.)  It is my understanding that █████ was still booking ███████ deals on 
████████ night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that █████ is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from ██████████,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that █████ can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Thanks

As you might be aware,  █████ Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night █████████ night and until 200 
am ██████  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on ██████ to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

█████
