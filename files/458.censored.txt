████, 

Here is a rentroll for █████████.  

What is the outstanding balance on #1.  It looks like 190 + 110(█████████)= 
300.  I don't think we should make him pay late fees if can't communicate 
clearly.

#2 still owe deposit?

#9  What day will she pay and is she going to pay ███████ or biweekly.

Have a good weekend.  I will talk to you █████████.

In ███████████████ we should know for sure if these buyers are going to buy 
the property.  I will keep you informed.

███████
