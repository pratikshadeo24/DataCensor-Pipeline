████,

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the "Rent Due" column.  The 
other questions I had about ███████████ rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to ██████, but paid nothing █████████.  Why?

I spoke to ██████████.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and █████████████.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let ████ know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without ████ and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay █████████ very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As ████ and ████ 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over ███████████.

███████
